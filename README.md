## Comp Tracker ##

A scraping API to simplify event registration dates and tracking.

The backend is Flask with scraping functionality built on SeleniumBase. It's not clear if there will be a front end added. Eventually this will support a Discord bot for interactivity so the frontend is not a priority.
